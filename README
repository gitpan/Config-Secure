Config::Secure version 0.0.1
==========================

Welcome to Config::Secure

  This module opens and parses data passed in from PSC 
(See DEPENDANCIES below). I have tried to make it simple
and robust, but keep in mind this is the first alpha
release, and my first CPAN module. It will improve I am
sure.

INSTALLATION

Ideally this module would be installed as a system-wide module, 
but we do not live in an ideal world...

To install this module system-wide type the following:

   perl Makefile.PL
   make
   make test
   make install

If you want to install it somewhere else like /home/ant/perl/
you would run

   perl Makefile.PL PREFIX=/home/ant/perl/
   make
   make test
   make install

You will see output similar to 
Installing /home/ant/perl/lib/site_perl/5.6.1/auto/Config/Secure/autosplit.ix
Installing /home/ant/perl/lib/site_perl/5.6.1/Config/Secure.pm
Installing /home/ant/perl/share/man/man3/Config::Secure.3pm

You need this:
Installing /home/ant/perl/lib/site_perl/5.6.1/Config/Secure.pm
           ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
You would then need to put this:
use lib '/home/ant/perl/lib/site_perl/5.6.1/';

in any of your scripts that use this version of Config::Secure
It should always be the same except for the last dir, which
is the version of perl you are running.   

DEPENDENCIES

This module interfaces data passed when a script is called by
Perl Secure Conf (PSC). To get PSC go to the website
http://psc.sourceforge.net/
This is also the home of the Config::Secure module, since I wrote
both.
